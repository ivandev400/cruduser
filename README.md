This is CRUD Laravel application. In this application there is Users list, you can read, create, update and delete users.

What I have used: Laravel, Docker, migrations, Eloquent ORM.

In order to use this application you need to manage your work environment and do some commands in terminal.Use UserTableSeeder for testing.
